## How to Use

1. Save the script as `windows11-installer.ps1`.
2. Run PowerShell as Administrator.

- Manually add your SSH key to GitHub and configure tools like Espanso and Neovim after running the script.
- Install [GnuWin32](https://sourceforge.net/projects/gnuwin32/) and set on path for NvChad to work correctly.
